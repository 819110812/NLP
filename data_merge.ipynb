       "'AB  - Background: Few studies have investigated the risks of subsequent primary       neoplasms after adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer. We investigated the       risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA       cancer. Methods: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a       population-based cohort of 200\\u2008945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15–39        years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was       established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics       and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first       occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this       analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16        types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female);       Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin       lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital;       leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per       10\\u2008000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent       primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer. Findings: During the 2\\u2008631\\u2008326       person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16·8 years, IQR 10·5–25·2), 12\\u2008321       subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11\\u2008565 survivors, most frequently        among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin       lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19·5 per 10\\u2008000       person-years (95% CI 17·4–21·5) in survivors of breast cancer, 10·2 (8·0–12·4) in       survivors of cervical cancer, 18·9 (16·6–21·1) in survivors of testicular cancer,       55·7 (50·4–61·1) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29·9 (26·3–33·6) in       male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent       primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11·9% (95% CI 11·3–12·6) in       survivors of breast cancer, 15·8% (14·8–16·7) in survivors of cervical cancer,       20·2% (18·9–21·5) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26·6% (24·7–28·6) in female        survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16·5% (15·2–18·0) in male survivors of Hodgkin       lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of       cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and       Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent       primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total       excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable       proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated.        Interpretation: Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary       neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms        in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin       lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term       follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers       indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden       of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.

       "' Background: Few studies have investigated the risks of subsequent primary       neoplasms after adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer. We investigated the       risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA       cancer. Methods: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a       population-based cohort of 200\\u2008945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15–39        years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was       established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics       and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first       occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this       analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16        types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female);       Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin       lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital;       leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per       10\\u2008000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent       primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer. Findings: During the 2\\u2008631\\u2008326       person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16·8 years, IQR 10·5–25·2), 12\\u2008321       subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11\\u2008565 survivors, most frequently        among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin       lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19·5 per 10\\u2008000       person-years (95% CI 17·4–21·5) in survivors of breast cancer, 10·2 (8·0–12·4) in       survivors of cervical cancer, 18·9 (16·6–21·1) in survivors of testicular cancer,       55·7 (50·4–61·1) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29·9 (26·3–33·6) in       male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent       primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11·9% (95% CI 11·3–12·6) in       survivors of breast cancer, 15·8% (14·8–16·7) in survivors of cervical cancer,       20·2% (18·9–21·5) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26·6% (24·7–28·6) in female        survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16·5% (15·2–18·0) in male survivors of Hodgkin       lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of       cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and       Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent       primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total       excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable       proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated.        Interpretation: Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary       neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms        in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin       lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term       follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers       indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden       of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.
